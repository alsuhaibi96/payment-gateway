        <p class="text-justify fs-5 ms-5 mt-5">Before using the eCommerce, you must make sure that configuration in the Merchant portal is set properly. There are 3 main functions:</p>
        <ul class="text-justify fs-5 ms-5 mt-5">
          <li>Integration Keys: generate integration keys (secret and publishable key)</li>
          <li>Webhook URL: Set the webhook URL to receive the payment notification</li>
          <li>Payment Methods: Set what payments can be received in Wasel Checkout.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="h1 ms-5 mt-5 fw-bold">Private and public keys</p>
        <p class=" text-justify fs-5 ms-5 mt-5">
          You MUST provide Private and public Keys in order to call any request in Wasel Checkout. Each merchant will have his unique keys which he can generate from the merchant portal directly. For testing purposes, below is the keys that will help you while integrating. Note that this is in UAT ONLY. If you need to move to production, then contact
          <a href="sales@waslpayment.com">A Wasel Sales</a>  to register with Wasel as a merchant and get your own keys.
